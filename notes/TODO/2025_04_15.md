# TODO 2025/04/15

## Initial states

### Stage 1
- Data mode
- Narrower research (either images or tabular data - may be connected but difficult)
> Handling mostly images with AE, open for tabular and different data

### Stage 2
- Generating many counterfactulas and ranking them (maybe change metrics)
> Weighted sum of currently known metrics 
  
### Stage 3
- Select from dataset - aggregation methods (IdealPoint, kNN, etc.)
> Prototypes with kNN seems the best, to further investigation. No related papers found.

## Surveys 
- Potentially ask Jacek Karolczak
> ?
- Mabe something can be migrated from Prototypes to CFs
> In ALIBI, and paper - CFProto
- Different classifiers (good, avg, poor) -> survey:
  - User is looking at the representant
  - User rates whether classifier performs good
  - "Hej co Ty tu podałeś za wyjaśnienie? Ono jest głupie, więc Ty jesteś głupi"
  > Seems cool, but further work needed to start working on prototypes
- CF + feature importance???
> ?
- Relate surveys results (quality ranked by users) + CF metrics:
  - Good for user == good metric (e.g. proximity)
  > Good idea, further research required
- Another survey - select number of CFs - user preference
> As aforementioned
- Do not rate the explainer but classifier / CF

---

- Interface for surveys - Tinder-like - few questions regarding CFs. Choose your match\
> Ok.
- Eg, one - Ideal Point; more - entire Pareto front
> + kNN
